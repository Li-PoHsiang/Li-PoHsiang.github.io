  Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology may pose significant security risks to academic research, including potential threats such as data privacy breaches, unfair evaluations caused by algorithmic bias, and fraudulent academic outputs. Building upon this risk prevention foundation, this study constructs an intelligent review mechanism centered on GenAI technology, aiming to effectively address the growing challenge of academic misconduct through dual pathways of standardization and efficiency enhancement, while achieving precise pre-assessment of academic quality. Based on the modular deconstruction principle of ‘Problem-Task-Technology’, this study designs an academic risk governance framework that covers the regulation and efficiency improvement path as well as the quality evaluation framework. The GenAI -driven academic risk governance framework, on one hand, addresses academic misconduct through normative verification, misconduct content screening, evaluation expert recommendation and review process feedback. On the other hand, it achieves academic quality evaluation by extracting content value, conducting multi-dimensional innovation evaluation, and locating contribution trends, thereby comprehensively enhancing governance efficiency. The governance of academic misconduct and process design aim to directly improve intelligent evaluation effectiveness, while academic quality evaluation provides a reference benchmark for expert review. The synergistic effect of them effectively promotes the practical implementation of the academic risk governance framework.
