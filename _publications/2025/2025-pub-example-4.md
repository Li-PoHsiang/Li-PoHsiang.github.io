  Technological opportunities (TOs) are the potential and set of possibilities for technology advances in a given industry. When enterprises are able to catch and adapt to them in a timely manner, they can grab market share from competitors who have failed to adapt to these challenges. However, when there exist large gaps between enterprises and their competitors, it should be carefully evaluated whether enterprise-specific TOs are worth exploring. Moreover, faced with diversified competitive relations, enterprises also need to formulate differentiated research and development (R&D) strategies for different TOs. To address these research gaps, this paper argues for the theoretical concepts of technical windows (TWs), emerging technologies (ETs), and TOs, and proposes a three-stage framework to detect enterprise-specific TOs.
