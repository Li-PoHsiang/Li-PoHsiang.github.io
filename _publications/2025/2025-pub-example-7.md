This study is based on a ternary fusion intelligence-driven smart healthcare service architecture, which clarifies the operating body, logic, and intrinsic modules.
This study introduces the theory of human-machine-thing ternary space to deconstruct the relevant subjects of smart healthcare services and analyze their bridging and fusion mechanisms. By dissecting the core modules and components of the service architecture, it integrates intelligent technologies to achieve the full-process transformation from data to knowledge.
Based on the ternary fusion intelligence, the efficient paradigm of human-computer collaboration is clarified, an efficient and intelligent healthcare service system is constructed, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the service process is verified and explained with the help of specific cases of healthcare organizations.
The idea of componentization has been widely recognized at the theoretical level, but its realization path in the specific practice of smart healthcare still faces challenges, especially the interaction mechanism between components, the dynamic splicing mode, and the scenario adaptability, which still need to be explored and refined.
Ternary fusion intelligence facilitates flexible reorganization and precise adaptation of service components to meet diverse healthcare needs.
