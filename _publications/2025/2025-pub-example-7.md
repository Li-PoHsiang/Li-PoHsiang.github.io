  Under the technology-dominated competition pattern, it is practically significant to accurately assess the technological competitiveness of enterprises and locate their advantages to specific knowledge dimensions. This research constructs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that integrates quality, scale and innovation. This framework reveals the differentiated capability performance of enterprises in different technology dimensions through multifaceted approaches such as semantic analysis, network analysis and patent value evaluation, combined with the probability distribution relationship between patents and knowledge.
