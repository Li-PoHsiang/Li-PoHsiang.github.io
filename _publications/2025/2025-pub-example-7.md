  This study introduces the theory of human-machine-thing ternary space to deconstruct the relevant subjects of smart healthcare services and analyze their bridging and fusion mechanisms. By dissecting the core modules and components of the service architecture, it integrates intelligent technologies to achieve the full-process transformation from data to knowledge.
