  The cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) industry plays a crucial role in the transformation of foreign trade and the upgrading of innovative development, driven by information technology and international trade policies. However, the distinctive operational pattern of CBEC enterprises necessitates the customization of the corporate credit evaluation framework to their specific features, which is absent in the existing studies. This paper proposes an integrated decision framework that incorporates multi-source features and machine learning algorithms to achieve customized credit evaluation for CBEC enterprises.
