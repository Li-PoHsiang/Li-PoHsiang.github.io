  Existing studies on the detection of emerging scientific topics (ESTs) overemphasize the newness and neglect content innovation of knowledge. Moreover, they also ignore the lag existing in knowledge diffusion. In this paper, we propose a four-stage detection framework for ESTs that maps emerging attributes from paper entities to scientific topics.
