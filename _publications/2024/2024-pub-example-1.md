abstract: >-
  Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has evolved over time into a mature interdisciplinary scientific field. However, there is a lack of research to explore the disciplinary association patterns and diffusion trajectories of scientific knowledge within this field. This research proposes a knowledge tracing framework that combines text analysis based on scientific texts and main path extraction based on citation networks to fill this gap.
