abstract: >-
  It is the important issue to promote the value realization of data elements through clarifying the multiple stakeholders and multi-source heterogeneous data of scientific and technological knowledge, and their synergistic mechanism, as well as delineating the knowledge extraction paths empowered with big data and intelligent technology. Based on the process of data-to-wisdom derivation in the DIKW chain, a synergistic framework of scientific and technological knowledge involving multiple stakeholders, such as universities, research institutes, enterprises, government and the public, has been constructed, covering multi-source data such as papers, patents, products, policies and user-generated content. Then, the front-end and back-end structures of scientific and technological knowledge extraction paths are expanded, as well as the knowledge extraction outcomes and their diverse service scenarios under intelligent strategy combination patterns are explored.
