    Existing dissertation impact evaluation indexes have limitations, which make it difficult to comprehensively and accurately assess the contribution of research achievements, to solve this problem, this paper aims to construct a dissertation impact evaluation model that integrates academic and social dimensions [Method/process] This paper constructs an impact evaluation model from both academic and social dimensions. In the academic dimension, citation is weighted by integrating influential factors such as citation position, citation sentiment, citation relevance and temporal heterogeneity to construct the academic impact index. In the social dimension, the indicators are selected from five aspects: use, access, mention, social media and citation to construct the social impact evaluation framework The empirical analysis shows that the paper impact evaluation model constructed in this paper can more comprehensively and accurately assess the impact of papers and identify high-impact papers. The sensitivity analysis of the weights and the comparative analysis found that the model has good robustness and effectiveness. This paper proposes a new method for evaluating academic papers that integrates academic impact and social impact, which can reflect the dual impact of papers in the academic and social fields, thereby more effectively identifying high-impact papers.Tracking technology evolution paths is crucial for understanding innovation dynamics. However, current studies frequently only use text-based methods, which limit their capacity to capture the structural linkages found in technology knowledge. To address this gap, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines text embedding and network embedding to analyze technology evolution paths. Using a dataset of 35983 patents in the battery electric vehicle (BEV) domain, we extract high-dimensional semantic features from patent texts while simultaneously capturing structural relationships between patents by constructing a heterogeneous information network. By fusing these two embeddings, we construct technology evolution paths based on cosine similarity measures. The proposed method effectively reveals knowledge diffusion patterns and emerging technology trends. In addition, through pair sample t-test and topic coherence analysis, we found that the proposed method identifies more comprehensive technology evolution trajectories.
